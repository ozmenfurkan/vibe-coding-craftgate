# Documentation Context Strategy
When the user asks about "Payment Flow", "3D Secure", or "Database Schema", refer to the files in the `docs/` folder.

# Key References
- **Payment Logic:** Refer to `docs/payment-flow.pdf` for the step-by-step state machine logic.
- **API Contract:** Ensure implementation matches `docs/api-specs.md`.
- **Database:** If modifying entities, check `docs/db-schema.md` (if exists) for consistency.

# How to use PDFs
If the requested information is inside a PDF (e.g., `payment-flow.pdf`), explicitly mention that you are reading from that file. If you cannot parse a specific section, ask the user to copy the relevant text.
